"""
list.index(x[, start[, end]])
Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x. 

!!!!Raises a ValueError if there is no such item!!!!

The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.
"""

list.count(ele)
#to find some element to see if that is in a list, you can use this one instead.

palindrome problem: 
usually odd and even are different cases. Consider them seperately.
